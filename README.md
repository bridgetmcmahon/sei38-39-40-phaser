# SEI38, SEI39, SEI40 Phaser Tutorial
### 2 December 2020

Hi all

Thank you for joining me today for the Phaser tutorial! I hope you all found it enjoyable (despite the npm and server issues at the start - apologies for that).

I've uploaded a working version of the game, but it's by no means complete. I'd encourage you to play around with some of the variables we've used - things like gravity, speed and velocity are all easily tweaked.

## Other things to do with this game

If you feel like a challenge and some extra homework (because you don't get enough of that already), here's some things you can try:

- Add or change the 'game over' visuals - add some text, change the colours, add an animation...
- Add a reset button to start the game over after you're hit by a bomb
- Make it time-based rather than score-based
- Add another player
- Add more obstacles
- Enable side scrolling

...and anything else you can think of!
